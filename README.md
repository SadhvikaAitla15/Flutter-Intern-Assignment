# Flutter Intern Assignment

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **Flutter Intern Assignment**.  
The project demonstrates my approach to solving the given requirements, with a focus on clean code, modular structure, and Flutter best practices.

## 🚀 Features

- Clean and scalable project structure.
- Separation of UI, business logic, and data models.
- State management using **Provider / Riverpod / setState** (whichever you used).
- API integration with error handling.
- Responsive UI for multiple screen sizes.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:SadhvikaAitla15/Flutter-Intern-Assignment.git
   cd Flutter-Intern-Assignment
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   flutter pub get
3. Run the app:
   flutter run
4. 📝 Approach

Followed a modular architecture to keep the codebase clean.

Used Flutter’s widget system to build reusable components.

Implemented state management to handle app data efficiently.

Focused on responsive design and smooth user experience.

Documented the process in this README for easier setup and understanding.
